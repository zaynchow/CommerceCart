# Commerce Cart

### An easy to navigate e-commerce store simulator for user analytics

***

Commerce Cart is a full-fledged, user-friendly, easy to navigate, e-commerce store with an admin dashboard for consumer
analytics. This store has minimised the number of steps that take for a consumer from entering the store to the placing
the order. Commerce Cart is also enriched with all the attractive must-have features for an e-commerce store such as
cart, product category, order history and much more. Customers can use this app and shop like a traditional e-commerce
store. This can also be used as a production or a staging app. Great for use as an analytic tool too as this app
includes an admin dashboard which provides insights such as average checkout amount, most viewed product/product
category and much more. Commerce Cart can be a very useful tool for shop owners/investors/developers to test new
products and also gain insights/analytics on demographics of consumers, and their behaviours as this can be used as a
staging app before the actual production app is released. It can also be used to test new feature releases, or the
change of store function,design or layout on the shopper's ease of use.

As a freelancer, I have made a couple of e-commerce websites previously using WordPress and I have seen clients really
struggle discovering their target audience and profitable strategies. This app can help them gain insights on the
demographics of the shoppers and also identify profitable aspects of their store such as the most sold product/most
viewed product category.

**Phase 4: Task 3**

In my program the CommerceCart class acts as a pillar to each class by providing all the data needed for each class and
also stores all the changes to the data made by all classes. Instead of passing the CommerceCart object to each frame
class when initialised, I would refactor to make my program to implement a singleton structure so that only one instance
of CommerceCart is created and is available to all classes at all times. This would make my program more robust and
improve the integrity.
